  How to run Boundary services in dev mode and login for the first time.

# Run and Login to Boundary

To start Boundary in dev mode:

```bash
$ boundary dev
```

## Login to Boundary

Boundary uses a predictable login name (`admin`) and password (`password`) in
dev mode. These can be overridden, or randomly generated, with flags to
`boundary dev`.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">

```
$ boundary authenticate password \
         -login-name=admin \
         -password password \
         -auth-method-id=ampw_1234567890
```

If you are on linux or a minimal operating system that does not have dbus-launch installed, you will
raise an error to this effect. On linux systems, you can work around this by installing `dbus-x11` 
and `gnome-keyring` using your package manager. 

If you're unable to install these packages, or don't want to, you can tell the Boundary authenticate
command to not save the token to the operating system's key manager by setting `-token-name=none` flag 
or `BOUNDARY_TOKEN_NAME=none` env variable when running `boundary authentiate`. You'll be responsible
for setting the token in subsequent commands via `-token` flag or `BOUNDARY_TOKEN` env variable.

To authenticate to the Admin UI, open
[http://127.0.0.1:9200](http://127.0.0.1:9200) in a browser and enter the login
name and password:

You can also use these overrides to configure the [Terraform provider for
Boundary](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-boundary):

```hcl
provider "boundary" {
    base_url             = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
    auth_method_id       = "ampw_1234567890"
    auth_method_username = "admin"
    auth_method_password = "password"
}
```

Note in the example above we're setting `base_url` to `http` and not `https` as
the Boundary server does not use TLS in development mode.
